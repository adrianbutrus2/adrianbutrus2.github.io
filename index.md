I am majoring in Computer Science at CSUF and I expect to graduate in 2026.

My favorite CPSC 120 Labs

- **Lab 7**
- Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I am a fan of the game of Blackjack, my friends and I play it sometimes. I successfully crafted functions for the first time, 
enabling accurate calculation of a Blackjack hand's value, irrespective of the number of Aces in play. 

- **Lab 10** 
- Lab 10, part 1 was a favorite of mine because the program focuses on prime number calculations and file input/output, particularly checking if a number and its
reverse are prime and printing the original numbers that meet this criteria. This Lab was difficult for me making it one of my favorites. 

- **Lab 12**
- Lab 12, was a favorite of mine because it was the first time I created an image. The image had an appearance as if it was moving, but it was actually just an 
illusion, which I think is really cool. I hope to utilize this skill on my own personal projects and was super excited to learn this topic.
